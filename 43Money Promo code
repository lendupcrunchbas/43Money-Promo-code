Where does your money go? Paycheck comes in and bill payments go out. Who is in control? Most folks would like to say that they are in charge of their money, but if they do not know where their paycheck went, that idea might just be wrong. Do you know what you use your credit cards for? Do you know how much you owe towards them? How many short-term payday loans have you used to get by throughout the last year? If you are one of the many who are living in debt, you may be in denial as to who is in charge of your income.

One of the best ways to discover where your money goes is to track your expenses. Add up all your monthly bills and expenses and subtract from your total take-home income. How much is left over? Can you account for what is missing from your wallet or back? Where are the leaks? If you don't track down every purchase throughout the month, you may be spending money which should otherwise be set aside for payments. Some of the biggest culprits are trips to convenience stores, added trips to the grocery store; drive-through lines as well handouts to family members. Your children's allowance should be accounted for within the budget. Once you can get a real look at where your money goes you will be able to start plugging the leaks.
